# YTWindowFinder
A simple script that checks for a Firefox or Chrome tab with youtube open which writes the window title to a file for OBS to read later.

------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------------------------------------
1. Open a Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browser.
2. Open up YouTube and make sure the YouTube tab remains the open one, without that the script can't detect the title of the video.
Note: the browser doesn't have to be visible, you can minimize it or have some other program window overtop of it.
